That is, human centered, consistent, composable, and inclusive (see Tidy design principles for more details).\nNew to R? We recommend you take a look at R for data science before reading this book. We assume that you have R installed together with an adequate Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as RStudio or Positron. See this tutorial if you need guidance on how to get started. The book uses multiple packages that you will need to install. See the list of packages used in R Packages.\nNew to databases? We recommend you take a look at some web tutorials on SQL, such as SQLBolt or SQLZoo to have a basic understanding of how databases work.\nNew to the OMOP CDM? We’d recommend you pair this book with The Book of OHDSI.",

Or instead of using ODBC drivers, JDBC drivers can be used via the DatabaseConnector R package.\nIn the code snippets above, we created a new, empty, in-process DuckDB via database to which we then added our dataset. But we could have instead connected to an existing duckdb database. This could, for example, look like:\n\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(drv = duckdb(dbdir = \"my_duckdb_database.ducdkb\"))\n\nNote that if you point to a non-existing DuckDB file, this will be created with an empty database.\nIn this book, for simplicity, we will mostly be working with in-process DuckDB databases with synthetic data. However, when analysing real patient data we will be more often working with client-server databases, where we are connecting from our computer to a central server with the database or working with data held in the cloud. The approaches shown throughout this book will work in the same way for these other types of database management systems, but the way to connect to the database will be different (although still using DBI). In general, creating connections is supported by associated back-end packages. For example a connection to a Postgres database would use the RPostgres R package and look something like this:\n\nlibrary(DBI)\nlibrary(RPostgres)\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(\n  drv = Postgres(),\n  dbname = \"my_database\",\n  host = \"my_server\",\n  user = \"user\",\n  password = \"password\"\n)\n\nOr if using the DatabaseConnector R package creating a connection would look something like:\n\nlibrary(DatabaseConnector)\ndownloadJdbcDrivers(\"postgresql\")\ncon &lt;- connect(\n  dbms = \"postgresql\",\n  connectionString = \"jdbc:postgresql://my_server\",\n  user = \"user\",\n  password = \"password\"\n)",

Using the dbplyr approach allows us to support multiple different SQL dialects and back-ends by just writing R code.\n\n\n\nNot having to worry about the SQL translation behind our queries allows us to query the database in a simple way even for more complex questions. For instance, suppose now that we are particularly interested in the body mass variable. We can first notice that there are a couple of missing records for this.\n\npenguins_db |&gt;\n  mutate(missing_body_mass_g = if_else(is.na(body_mass_g), 1, 0)) |&gt;\n  group_by(species, missing_body_mass_g) |&gt;\n  tally()\n\n# Source:   SQL [?? x 3]\n# Database: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1/:memory:]\n  species   missing_body_mass_g     n\n  &lt;fct&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie                      0   151\n2 Gentoo                      0   123\n3 Adelie                      1     1\n4 Gentoo                      1     1\n5 Chinstrap                   0    68\n\n\nWe can get the mean for each of the species, first dropping those two missing records:\n\npenguins_db |&gt;\n  group_by(species) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_body_mass_g = round(mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)))\n\n# Source:   SQL [?? x 2]\n# Database: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1/:memory:]\n  species   mean_body_mass_g\n  &lt;fct&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie                3701\n2 Chinstrap             3733\n3 Gentoo                5076\n\n\nWe could also make a histogram of values for each of the species using the ggplot2 package.

But what about if we stratify this query by species?\n\npenguins_db |&gt;\n  select(\"species\", \"body_mass_g\", \"bill_depth_mm\") |&gt;\n  collect() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +\n  facet_grid(species ~ .) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  xlab(\"Bill depth (mm)\") +\n  ylab(\"Body mass (g)\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as having an example of working with data in database from R, you also have an example of Simpson’s paradox!",

    "text": "2.1 Tidyverse functions\nWe saw in the previous chapter that we can use familiar dplyr verbs with data held in a database. There, we were working with just a single table which we loaded into the database. When working with databases, we will typically be working with multiple tables (as we’ll see later when working with data in the OMOP CDM format). For this chapter, we will see more tidyverse functionality that can be used with data in a database, this time using the nycflights13 data. As we can see, we now have a set of related tables with data on flights departing from New York City airports in 2013.\nLet’s load the required libraries, add our data to a DuckDB database, and then create references to each of these tables.\nFor almost all analyses, we want to go from having our starting data spread out across multiple tables in the database to a single tidy table containing all the data we need for the specific analysis. We can often get to our tidy analytic dataset using the tidyverse functions below (most of which come from dplyr, but a couple also from the tidyr package). These functions all work with data in a database by generating SQL that will have the same purpose as if these functions were being run against data in R.",

    "text": "3.1 Data types\nIn the previous chapter, Chapter 2, we saw that there are a core set of tidyverse functions that can be used with databases to extract data for analysis. The SQL code used in the previous chapter is consistent across database management systems, since it only involves basic operations such as joins and variable selection.\nFor more complex data pipelines, we will, however, often need to incorporate additional expressions within these functions. Because of differences across database management systems, the translated SQL can vary. Moreover, and something we need to keep in mind when working with multiple data partners, some expressions are only supported for some databases. When writing code that should work across different database management systems, we need to keep in mind which expressions are supported where. To help with this, the sections below show the available SQL translations for common expressions we might want to use.\nLet’s first load the packages which these expressions come from. In addition to base R types, bit64 adds support for integer64. The stringr package provides functions for working with strings, while clock has various functions for working with dates. Many other useful expressions will come from dplyr itself.\nCommonly used data types are consistently supported across database backends. We can use the base as.numeric(), as.integer(), as.character(), as.Date(), and as.POSIXct(). We can also use as.integer64() from the bit64 package to coerce to integer64, and the as_date() and as_datetime() from the clock package instead of as.Date() and as.POSIXct(), respectively.",

    "text": "3.7 Window functions\nWindow functions differ from data aggregation functions in that they perform calculations across rows that are related to the current row, rather than collapsing multiple rows into a single result. For these operations, we use mutate() instead of summarise().\nFor instance, we can use window functions like cumsum() and cummean() to calculate running totals and averages, or lag() and lead() to help compare rows to their preceding or following rows.\nGiven that window functions compare rows to rows before or after them, we will often use arrange() or window_order() to specify the order of rows. This will translate into an ORDER BY clause in the SQL. In addition, we may well also want to apply window functions within some specific groupings in our data. Using group_by() would result in a PARTITION BY clause in the translated SQL so that the window function operates on each group independently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipShow SQL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuckDBPostgresSQL

    "text": "3.8 Calculating quantiles, including the median\nSo far we’ve seen that we can perform various data manipulations and calculate summary statistics for different database management systems using the same R code. Although the translated SQL has been different, the databases all supported similar approaches to perform these queries.\nA case where this is not true is when we are interested in summarising distributions of the data and estimating quantiles. For example, let’s take estimating the median as an example. Some databases only support calculating the median as an aggregation function similar to how min, mean, and max were calculated above. However, some others only support it as a window function like lead and lag above. Unfortunately, this means that for some databases, quantiles can only be calculated using the summarise aggregation approach, while in others only the mutate window approach can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipShow SQL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuckDBPostgresSQL ServerRedshiftSnowflakeSpark\n\n\n\ncon &lt;- simulate_duckdb()\nlazy_frame(x = c(1, 2), con = con) |&gt;\n  summarise(median = median(x, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  show_query()\n\n&lt;SQL&gt;\nSELECT MEDIAN(`x`) AS `median`\nFROM `df`\n\nlazy_frame(x = c(1, 2), con = con) |&gt;\n  mutate(median = median(x, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  show_query()\n\n&lt;SQL&gt;\nSELECT `df`.*, MEDIAN(`x`) OVER () AS `median`\nFROM `df`\n\n\n\n\n\ncon &lt;- simulate_postgres()\nlazy_frame(x = c(1, 2), con = con) |&gt;\n  summarise(median = median(x, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  show_query()\n\n&lt;SQL&gt;\nSELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY `x`) AS `median`\nFROM `df`\n\nlazy_frame(x = c(1, 2), con = con) |&gt;\n  mutate(median = median(x, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  show_query()\n\nError in `median()`:\n!

    "text": "4.2 Creating functions for the data model\nGiven that we know the structure of the data, we can build a set of functions tailored to the Lahman data model to simplify data analyses.\nLet’s start by creating a simple function that returns the teams each player has played for. We can see that the code we use follows on from the last couple of chapters.\n\ngetTeams &lt;- function(lahman, name = \"Barry Bonds\") {\n  lahman$Batting |&gt;\n    inner_join(\n      lahman$People |&gt;\n        mutate(full_name = paste0(nameFirst, \" \", nameLast)) |&gt;\n        filter(full_name %in% name) |&gt;\n        select(\"playerID\"),\n      by = \"playerID\"\n    ) |&gt;\n    distinct(teamID, yearID) |&gt;\n    left_join(\n      lahman$Teams,\n      by = c(\"teamID\", \"yearID\")\n    ) |&gt;\n    distinct(name)\n}\n\nNow we can easily get which teams a player has represented. We can see how changing the player name changes the SQL that is run behind the scenes.\n\ngetTeams(lahman = lahman, name = \"Babe Ruth\")\n\n# Source:   SQL [?? x 1]\n# Database: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1/:memory:]\n  name            \n  &lt;chr&gt;           \n1 Boston Red Sox  \n2 New York Yankees\n3 Boston Braves   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteShow query\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;SQL&gt;\nSELECT DISTINCT q01.*\nFROM (\n  SELECT \"name\"\n  FROM (\n    SELECT DISTINCT q01.*\n    FROM (\n      SELECT teamID, yearID\n      FROM Batting\n      INNER JOIN (\n        SELECT playerID\n        FROM (\n          SELECT People.*, CONCAT_WS('', nameFirst, ' ', nameLast) AS full_name\n          FROM People\n        ) q01\n        WHERE (full_name IN ('Babe Ruth'))\n      ) RHS\n        ON (Batting.playerID = RHS.playerID)\n    ) q01\n  ) LHS\n  LEFT JOIN Teams\n    ON (LHS.teamID = Teams.teamID AND LHS.yearID = Teams.yearID)\n) q01\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngetTeams(lahman = lahman, name = \"Barry Bonds\")\n\n# Source:   SQL [?? x 1]\n# Database: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1/:memory:]\n  name                \n  &lt;chr&gt;               \n1 Pittsburgh Pirates  \n2 San Francisco Giants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteShow query\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;SQL&gt;\nSELECT DISTINCT q01.*\nFROM (\n  SELECT \"name\"\n  FROM (\n    SELECT DISTINCT q01.*\n    FROM (\n      SELECT teamID, yearID\n      FROM Batting\n      INNER JOIN (\n        SELECT playerID\n        FROM (\n          SELECT People.*, CONCAT_WS('', nameFirst, ' ', nameLast) AS full_name\n          FROM People\n        ) q01\n        WHERE (full_name IN ('Barry Bonds'))\n      ) RHS\n        ON (Batting.playerID = RHS.playerID)\n    ) q01\n  ) LHS\n  LEFT JOIN Teams\n    ON (LHS.teamID = Teams.teamID AND LHS.yearID = Teams.yearID)\n) q01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipChoosing the right time to collect data into R\n\n\n\n\n\nThe function collect() brings data out of the database and into R. When working with large datasets, as is often the case when interacting with a database, we typically want to keep as much computation as possible on the database side. In the case of our getTeams() function, for example, everything is done on the database side. Collecting the result will bring the result of the teams the person played for out of the database. In this case, we could also use pull() to get our result out as a vector rather than a data frame.\n\ngetTeams(lahman = lahman, name = \"Barry Bonds\") |&gt;\n  collect()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 1\n  name                \n  &lt;chr&gt;               \n1 San Francisco Giants\n2 Pittsburgh Pirates  \n\ngetTeams(lahman = lahman, name = \"Barry Bonds\") |&gt;\n  pull()\n\n[1] \"San Francisco Giants\" \"Pittsburgh Pirates\"  \n\n\nHowever, in other cases we may need to collect the data to perform analyses that can not be done in SQL.

This shows the importance of being aware of the SQL code being executed when working in R with databases.\n\n\n4.3.2 Piping and SQL\nPiping functions has little impact on performance when using R with data in memory. However, when working with a database, the SQL generated will differ when using multiple function calls (with a separate operation specified in each) instead of multiple operations within a single function call.\nFor example, a single mutate function creating two new variables would generate the below SQL.\n\nlahman$People |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    birthDatePlus1 = add_years(x = birthDate, n = 1L),\n    birthDatePlus10 = add_years(x = birthDate, n = 10L)\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(\"playerID\", \"birthDatePlus1\", \"birthDatePlus10\") |&gt;\n  show_query()\n\n&lt;SQL&gt;\nSELECT\n  playerID,\n  DATE_ADD(birthDate, INTERVAL (1) year) AS birthDatePlus1,\n  DATE_ADD(birthDate, INTERVAL (10) year) AS birthDatePlus10\nFROM People\n\n\nWhereas the SQL will be different if these were created using multiple mutate calls (with now one being created in a sub-query).\n\nlahman$People |&gt;\n  mutate(birthDatePlus1 = add_years(x = birthDate, n = 1L)) |&gt;\n  mutate(birthDatePlus10 = add_years(x = birthDate, n = 10L)) |&gt;\n  select(\"playerID\", \"birthDatePlus1\", \"birthDatePlus10\") |&gt;\n  show_query()\n\n&lt;SQL&gt;\nSELECT\n  playerID,\n  birthDatePlus1,\n  DATE_ADD(birthDate, INTERVAL (10) year) AS birthDatePlus10\nFROM (\n  SELECT People.*, DATE_ADD(birthDate, INTERVAL (1) year) AS birthDatePlus1\n  FROM People\n) q01\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Computing intermediate queries\nLet’s now summarise home runs (Batting table) and strike outs (Pitching table) by college player and their birth year. We can do this like so:\n\nplayers_with_college &lt;- lahman$People |&gt;\n  select(\"playerID\", \"birthYear\") |&gt;\n  inner_join(\n    lahman$CollegePlaying |&gt;\n      filter(!is.na(schoolID)) |&gt;\n      distinct(playerID, schoolID),\n    by = \"playerID\"\n  )\n\nlahman$Batting |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    players_with_college,\n    by = \"playerID\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(schoolID, birthYear) |&gt;\n  summarise(home_runs = sum(H, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  collect()\n\n# A tibble: 6,205 × 3\n   schoolID   birthYear home_runs\n   &lt;chr&gt;

However, in some cases, the SQL associated code can become very complicated and unmanageable, resulting with inefficient code. Therefore, although we do not want to overuse computation of intermediate queries, it is often useful when creating our analytic pipelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIndexes\n\n\n\n\n\nSome SQL dialects use indexes for more efficient ‘joins’ performance. Briefly speaking, indexes store the location of the different values of a column. Every time that you create a new table with compute(), the indexes will not be carried over. Hence, if you want your new table to keep some indexes, you will have to add them manually. That is why sometimes it will not be more efficient to add a compute() in between, because the new table generated will not have the indexes that make your query to be executed faster.",

    "text": "5.2 Creating a reference to the OMOP CDM\nAs we saw in Chapter 4, creating a data model in R to represent the OMOP CDM can provide a basis for analytic pipelines using the data. Luckily for us, we won’t have to create functions and methods for this ourselves. Instead, we will use the omopgenerics package which defines a data model for OMOP CDM data and the CDMConnector package which provides functions for connecting to OMOP CDM data held in a database.\nTo see how this works, we will use the omock package to create example data in the format of the OMOP CDM, which we will then copy to a DuckDB database created by the duckdb package.\n\nlibrary(duckdb)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(omock)\nlibrary(CDMConnector)\nlibrary(omopgenerics)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\ncdm_local &lt;- mockCdmReference() |&gt;\n  mockPerson(nPerson = 100) |&gt;\n  mockObservationPeriod() |&gt;\n  mockConditionOccurrence() |&gt;\n  mockDrugExposure() |&gt;\n  mockObservation() |&gt;\n  mockMeasurement() |&gt;\n  mockVisitOccurrence() |&gt;\n  mockProcedureOccurrence()\n\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(drv = duckdb())\nsrc &lt;- dbSource(con = con, writeSchema = \"main\")\n\ncdm &lt;- insertCdmTo(cdm = cdm_local, to = src)\n\nNote that insertCdmTo() output is already a &lt;cdm_reference&gt; object. But how would we create this cdm reference from the connection? We can use the function cdmFromCon() from CDMConnector to create our cdm reference. Note that as well as specifying the schema containing our OMOP CDM tables, we will also specify a write schema where any database tables we create during our analysis will be stored. Often, our OMOP CDM tables will be in a schema that we only have read-access to, and we’ll have another schema where we can have write-access and where intermediate tables can be created for a given study.\n\ncdm &lt;- cdmFromCon(\n  con = con,\n  cdmSchema = \"main\",\n  writeSchema = \"main\",\n  cdmName = \"example_data\"\n)\n\n\ncdm\n\n\n\n\n── # OMOP CDM reference (duckdb) of example_data ───────────────────────────────\n\n\n• omop tables: cdm_source, concept, concept_ancestor, concept_relationship,\nconcept_synonym, condition_occurrence, drug_exposure, drug_strength,\nmeasurement, observation, observation_period, person, procedure_occurrence,\nvisit_occurrence, vocabulary\n\n\n• cohort tables: -\n\n\n• achilles tables: -\n\n\n• other tables: -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSetting a write prefix\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also specify a write prefix and this will be used whenever permanent tables are created in the write schema. This can be useful when we’re sharing our write schema with others and want to avoid table name conflicts and easily drop tables created as part of a particular study.\n\ncdm &lt;- cdmFromCon(\n  con = con,\n  cdmSchema = \"main\",\n  writeSchema = \"main\",\n  writePrefix = \"my_study_\",\n  cdmName = \"example_data\"\n)\n\nNote you only have to specify this writePrefix once at the connection stage, and then the cdm_reference object will store that and use it every time that you create a new table.\n\n\n\nWe can see that we now have an object that contains references to all the OMOP CDM tables. We can reference specific tables using the “$” or “[[ … ]]” operators.\n\ncdm$person\n\n# Source:   table&lt;person&gt; [?? x 18]\n# Database: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1/:memory:]\n   person_id gender_concept_id year_of_birth month_of_birth day_of_birth\n       &lt;int&gt;             &lt;int&gt;         &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n 1         1              8532          1953              2            3\n 2         2              8507          1993              8           16\n 3         3              8507          1953              8            9\n 4         4              8507          1960              6           12\n 5         5              8507          1967              1           13\n 6         6              8532          1982              9            2\n 7         7              8507          1991              6            2\n 8         8              8532          1994              4            4\n 9         9              8507          1974              9           12\n10        10              8532          1984              4           16\n# ℹ more rows\n# ℹ 13 more variables: race_concept_id &lt;int&gt;, ethnicity_concept_id &lt;int&gt;,\n#   birth_datetime &lt;dttm&gt;, location_id &lt;int&gt;, provider_id &lt;int&gt;,\n#   care_site_id &lt;int&gt;, person_source_value &lt;chr&gt;, gender_source_value &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   gender_source_concept_id &lt;int&gt;, race_source_value &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   race_source_concept_id &lt;int&gt;, ethnicity_source_value &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   ethnicity_source_concept_id &lt;int&gt;\n\ncdm[[\"observation_period\"]]\n\n# Source:   table&lt;observation_period&gt; [?? x 5]\n# Database: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1/:memory:]\n   person_id observation_period_s…¹ observation_period_e…² observation_period_id\n       &lt;int&gt; &lt;date&gt;                 &lt;date&gt;                                 &lt;int&gt;\n 1         1 1990-06-25             2003-12-23                                 1\n 2         2 1994-07-25             2013-04-23                                 2\n 3         3 2017-07-20             2018-06-24                                 3\n 4         4 1995-10-10             1998-08-12                                 4\n 5         5 1993-10-15             2005-08-03                                 5\n 6         6 1991-07-17             2005-09-28                                 6\n 7         7 1994-07-11             2009-04-09                                 7\n 8         8 1995-01-11             2002-06-11                                 8\n 9         9 1976-10-16             1989-04-17                                 9\n10        10 1986-04-22             2001-05-22                                10\n# ℹ more rows\n# ℹ abbreviated names: ¹​observation_period_start_date,\n#   ²​observation_period_end_date\n# ℹ 1 more variable: period_type_concept_id &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nNote that here we have first created a local version of the cdm with all the tables of interest with omock (cdm_local), then copied it to a DuckDB database, and finally created a reference to it with CDMConnector, so that we can work with the final cdm object as we normally would for one created with our own healthcare data.

It writes a local table to the database and adds it to the list of tables in the cdm reference. Internally, it uses dbWriteTable() but also handles the schema and table name automatically using the writeSchema and writePrefix from the cdm reference.\n\nIn general, for studies using OMOP CDM data, you should use insertTable() rather than dbWriteTable(). It ensures the table is both written to the correct location in the database and accessible through the cdm reference object. Only use dbWriteTable() if you are confident working directly with the database and understand its structure.\nNote insertTable() would also work for a local cdm reference or any other defined cdm reference source, whereas the dbWriteTable() is a database specific function.",

Meanwhile, leaving the underlying data unchanged is essential so that other study code can run against the data, unaffected by any of our changes.\nOne thing we can’t do, though, is alter the structure of OMOP CDM tables. For example, the following code would cause an error as the person table must always have the column person_id.\n\ncdm$person &lt;- cdm$person |&gt;\n  rename(\"new_id\" = \"person_id\")\n\nError in `newOmopTable()`:\n! person_id is not present in table person\n\n\nIn such a case we would have to call the table something else first, and then run the previous code:\n\ncdm$person_new &lt;- cdm$person |&gt;\n  rename(\"new_id\" = \"person_id\") |&gt;\n  compute(name = \"person_new\")\n\nNow we would be allowed to have this new table as an additional table in our cdm reference, knowing it was not in the format of one of the core OMOP CDM tables.\n\ncdm\n\n\n\n\n── # OMOP CDM reference (duckdb) of example_data ───────────────────────────────\n\n\n• omop tables: cdm_source, concept, concept_ancestor, concept_relationship,\nconcept_synonym, condition_occurrence, drug_exposure, drug_strength,\nmeasurement, observation, observation_period, person, procedure_occurrence,\nvisit_occurrence, vocabulary\n\n\n• cohort tables: -\n\n\n• achilles tables: -\n\n\n• other tables: person_new\n\n\nThe package omopgenerics provides a comprehensive list of the required features of a valid cdm reference.

This helps maintain the original database structure tidy and free of irrelevant data.\nHowever, one disadvantage of using temporary tables is that we will generally accumulate more and more of them as we go (in a single R session), whereas we can overwrite permanent tables continuously. For example, if our study code contains a loop that requires a compute, we would either overwrite an intermediate permanent table 100 times or create 100 different temporary tables in the process. In the latter case we should be wary of consuming a lot of drive memory, which could lead to performance issues or even crashes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotename argument in compute()\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in the previous examples we explicitly specified the name of the new table and whether it must be temporary or permanent (temporary = FALSE), but we do not need to populate the temporary field explicitly as if name is left as NULL (default behavior), then the table will be temporary (temporary = TRUE), and if the name argument is populated with a character (e.g., name = “my_custom_table”), then the created table will be permanent:\n\ncdm$person_new_temp &lt;- cdm$person |&gt;\n  compute()\n\ncdm$person_new_permanent &lt;- cdm$person |&gt;\n  compute(name = \"person_new_permanent\")",

    "text": "7.1 Adding specific demographics\nFor this chapter, we’ll again use our example COVID-19 dataset.\nAs part of an analysis, we almost always have a need to identify certain characteristics related to the individuals in our data. These characteristics might be time-invariant (i.e. a characteristic that does not change as time passes and a person ages) or time-varying.1\nThe PatientProfiles package makes it easy for us to add demographic information to tables in the OMOP CDM. Like the CDMConnector package we’ve seen previously, the fact that the structure of the OMOP CDM is known allows the PatientProfiles package to abstract away some common data manipulations required to do research with patient-level data.2\nLet’s say we’re interested in individuals’ age and sex at the time of diagnosis records held in the condition occurrence table. We can add these variables to the table as follows (noting that, since age is time-varying, we need to specify the date relative to which it should be calculated).\ncdm$condition_occurrence &lt;- cdm$condition_occurrence |&gt;\n  addSex() |&gt;\n  addAge(indexDate = \"condition_start_date\")\n\ncdm$condition_occurrence |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nRows: ??\nColumns: 18\nDatabase: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1//tmp/RtmpeMsgL7/file41a06b4682e3.duckdb]\n$ condition_occurrence_id       &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1…\n$ person_id                     &lt;int&gt; 2, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, 18, 18, 25,…\n$ condition_concept_id          &lt;int&gt; 381316, 321042, 381316, 37311061, 437663…\n$ condition_start_date          &lt;date&gt; 1986-09-08, 2021-06-23, 2021-04-07, 202…\n$ condition_start_datetime      &lt;dttm&gt; 1986-09-08, 2021-06-23, 2021-04-07, 202…\n$ condition_end_date            &lt;date&gt; 1986-09-08, 2021-06-23, 2021-04-07, 202…\n$ condition_end_datetime        &lt;dttm&gt; 1986-09-08, 2021-06-23, 2021-04-07, 202…\n$ condition_type_concept_id     &lt;int&gt; 38000175, 38000175, 38000175, 38000175, …\n$ condition_status_concept_id   &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ stop_reason                   &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ provider_id                   &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ visit_occurrence_id           &lt;int&gt; 19, 55, 67, 79, 79, 79, 79, 168, 171, 19…\n$ visit_detail_id               &lt;int&gt; 1000019, 1000055, 1000067, 1000079, 1000…\n$ condition_source_value        &lt;chr&gt; \"230690007\", \"410429000\", \"230690007\", \"…\n$ condition_source_concept_id   &lt;int&gt; 381316, 321042, 381316, 37311061, 437663…\n$ condition_status_source_value &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ sex                           &lt;chr&gt; \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\"…\n$ age                           &lt;int&gt; 57, 25, 97, 2, 2, 2, 2, 75, 77, 57, 76, …\nWe have now added two variables containing values for age and sex.\ncdm$condition_occurrence |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nRows: ??\nColumns: 18\nDatabase: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1//tmp/RtmpeMsgL7/file41a06b4682e3.duckdb]\n$ condition_occurrence_id       &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1…\n$ person_id                     &lt;int&gt; 2, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, 18, 18, 25,…\n$ condition_concept_id          &lt;int&gt; 381316, 321042, 381316, 37311061, 437663…\n$ condition_start_date          &lt;date&gt; 1986-09-08, 2021-06-23, 2021-04-07, 202…\n$ condition_start_datetime      &lt;dttm&gt; 1986-09-08, 2021-06-23, 2021-04-07, 202…\n$ condition_end_date            &lt;date&gt; 1986-09-08, 2021-06-23, 2021-04-07, 202…\n$ condition_end_datetime        &lt;dttm&gt; 1986-09-08, 2021-06-23, 2021-04-07, 202…\n$ condition_type_concept_id     &lt;int&gt; 38000175, 38000175, 38000175, 38000175, …\n$ condition_status_concept_id   &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ stop_reason                   &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ provider_id                   &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ visit_occurrence_id           &lt;int&gt; 19, 55, 67, 79, 79, 79, 79, 168, 171, 19…\n$ visit_detail_id               &lt;int&gt; 1000019, 1000055, 1000067, 1000079, 1000…\n$ condition_source_value        &lt;chr&gt; \"230690007\", \"410429000\", \"230690007\", \"…\n$ condition_source_concept_id   &lt;int&gt; 381316, 321042, 381316, 37311061, 437663…\n$ condition_status_source_value &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ sex                           &lt;chr&gt; \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\"…\n$ age                           &lt;int&gt; 57, 25, 97, 2, 2, 2, 2, 75, 77, 57, 76, …\nWith these now added, it is straightforward to calculate the mean age at condition start date by sex or even plot the distribution of age at diagnosis by sex.\ncdm$condition_occurrence |&gt;\n  group_by(sex) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  collect()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  sex    mean_age\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Female     50.8\n2 Male       56.5\ncdm$condition_occurrence |&gt;\n  select(\"person_id\", \"age\", \"sex\") |&gt;\n  collect() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(fill = sex)) +\n  facet_grid(sex ~ .) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(age), colour = \"black\", binwidth = 5) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")",

Can you guess its name? That’s right, we have addCategories() for this.\n\ncdm$condition_occurrence |&gt;\n  addPriorObservation(indexDate = \"condition_start_date\") |&gt;\n  addCategories(\n    variable = \"prior_observation\",\n    categories = list(\"prior_observation_group\" = list(\n      c(0, 364), c(365, Inf)\n    ))\n  ) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nRows: ??\nColumns: 20\nDatabase: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1//tmp/RtmpeMsgL7/file41a06b4682e3.duckdb]\n$ condition_occurrence_id       &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1…\n$ person_id                     &lt;int&gt; 2, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, 18, 18, 25,…\n$ condition_concept_id          &lt;int&gt; 381316, 321042, 381316, 37311061, 437663…\n$ condition_start_date          &lt;date&gt; 1986-09-08, 2021-06-23, 2021-04-07, 202…\n$ condition_start_datetime      &lt;dttm&gt; 1986-09-08, 2021-06-23, 2021-04-07, 202…\n$ condition_end_date            &lt;date&gt; 1986-09-08, 2021-06-23, 2021-04-07, 202…\n$ condition_end_datetime        &lt;dttm&gt; 1986-09-08, 2021-06-23, 2021-04-07, 202…\n$ condition_type_concept_id     &lt;int&gt; 38000175, 38000175, 38000175, 38000175, …\n$ condition_status_concept_id   &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ stop_reason                   &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ provider_id                   &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ visit_occurrence_id           &lt;int&gt; 19, 55, 67, 79, 79, 79, 79, 168, 171, 19…\n$ visit_detail_id               &lt;int&gt; 1000019, 1000055, 1000067, 1000079, 1000…\n$ condition_source_value        &lt;chr&gt; \"230690007\", \"410429000\", \"230690007\", \"…\n$ condition_source_concept_id   &lt;int&gt; 381316, 321042, 381316, 37311061, 437663…\n$ condition_status_source_value &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ sex                           &lt;chr&gt; \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\"…\n$ age                           &lt;int&gt; 57, 25, 97, 2, 2, 2, 2, 75, 77, 57, 76, …\n$ prior_observation             &lt;int&gt; 3437, 2898, 2842, 872, 872, 872, 872, 23…\n$ prior_observation_group       &lt;chr&gt; \"365 or above\", \"365 or above\", \"365 or …",

    "text": "7.4 Adding custom variables\nWhile PatientProfiles provides a range of functions that can help you add characteristics of interest, you may also want to add other features. Obviously, the package can’t cover all the possible custom characteristics you may wish to add. However, we will see two common groups of custom variables you may want to add:\n\nvariables derived from existing columns within the same table,\nvariables obtained from other tables and joined to our table of interest.\n\nIn the first case, where we want to add a new variable derived from existing variables within our table, we’ll typically use mutate() (from the dplyr package). For example, perhaps we just want to add a new variable to our observation period table that contains the year of each individual’s observation period start date. This is rather straightforward.\n\ncdm$observation_period &lt;- cdm$observation_period |&gt;\n  mutate(observation_period_start_year = get_year(observation_period_start_date))\n\ncdm$observation_period |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nRows: ??\nColumns: 6\nDatabase: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1//tmp/RtmpeMsgL7/file41a06b4682e3.duckdb]\n$ observation_period_id         &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1…\n$ person_id                     &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1…\n$ observation_period_start_date &lt;date&gt; 2014-05-09, 1977-04-11, 2014-04-19, 201…\n$ observation_period_end_date   &lt;date&gt; 2023-05-12, 1986-09-15, 2023-04-22, 202…\n$ period_type_concept_id        &lt;int&gt; 44814724, 44814724, 44814724, 44814724, …\n$ observation_period_start_year &lt;dbl&gt; 2014, 1977, 2014, 2014, 2013, 2013, 2013…\n\n\nThe second case is usually a more complex task, as adding a new variable involves joining to some other table following a certain logic. This table may have been created by some intermediate query that we wrote to derive the variable of interest. For example, let’s say we want to add the number of condition occurrence records for each individual to the person table (remember that we saw how to calculate this in the previous chapter). To do this, we will need to perform a join between the person and condition occurrence tables (as some people might not have any records in the condition occurrence table). Here we’ll create a table containing just the information we’re interested in and compute it to a temporary table.\n\ncondition_summary &lt;- cdm$person |&gt;\n  select(\"person_id\") |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    cdm$condition_occurrence |&gt;\n      group_by(person_id) |&gt;\n      count(name = \"condition_occurrence_records\"),\n    by = \"person_id\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(\"person_id\", \"condition_occurrence_records\") |&gt;\n  mutate(condition_occurrence_records = coalesce(condition_occurrence_records, 0)) |&gt;\n  compute()\n\ncondition_summary |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nRows: ??\nColumns: 2\nDatabase: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1//tmp/RtmpeMsgL7/file41a06b4682e3.duckdb]\n$ person_id                    &lt;int&gt; 2, 6, 7, 8, 16, 18, 25, 36, 40, 42, 44, 4…\n$ condition_occurrence_records &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 3,…\n\n\nWe can see what goes on behind the scenes by viewing the associated SQL.\n\ncdm$person |&gt;\n  select(\"person_id\") |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    cdm$condition_occurrence |&gt;\n      group_by(person_id) |&gt;\n      count(name = \"condition_occurrence_records\"),\n    by = \"person_id\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(\"person_id\", \"condition_occurrence_records\") |&gt;\n  mutate(condition_occurrence_records = coalesce(condition_occurrence_records, 0)) |&gt;\n  show_query()\n\n&lt;SQL&gt;\nSELECT\n  person_id,\n  COALESCE(condition_occurrence_records, 0.0) AS condition_occurrence_records\nFROM (\n  SELECT person.person_id AS person_id, condition_occurrence_records\n  FROM person\n  LEFT JOIN (\n    SELECT person_id, COUNT(*) AS condition_occurrence_records\n    FROM og_002_1762350437\n    GROUP BY person_id\n  ) RHS\n    ON (person.person_id = RHS.person_id)\n) q01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTaking care with joins\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen adding variables through joins we need to pay particular attention to the dimensions of the resulting table. While sometimes we may want to have additional rows added as well as new columns, this is often not desired. For example, if we have a table with one row per person, performing a left join to another table containing multiple rows per person will result in multiple rows per person in the output.\nExamples where to be careful include when joining to the observation period table, as individuals can have multiple observation periods, and when working with cohorts (which are the focus of the next chapter) as individuals can also enter the same study cohort multiple times.\nJust to underline how problematic joins can become if we don’t take care, here we join the condition occurrence table and the drug exposure table, both of which have multiple records per person. Even with our small synthetic dataset, this produces an extremely large table. When working with real patient data, which is oftentimes much, much larger, this would be extremely problematic (and would unlikely be needed to answer any research question). In other words, don’t try this at home!\n\ncdm$condition_occurrence |&gt;\n  tally()\n\n# Source:   SQL [?? x 1]\n# Database: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1//tmp/RtmpeMsgL7/file41a06b4682e3.duckdb]\n      n\n  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  9967\n\ncdm$drug_exposure |&gt;\n  tally()\n\n# Source:   SQL [?? x 1]\n# Database: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1//tmp/RtmpeMsgL7/file41a06b4682e3.duckdb]\n       n\n   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 337509\n\ncdm$condition_occurrence |&gt;\n  select(person_id, condition_start_date) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    cdm$drug_exposure |&gt;\n      select(person_id, drug_exposure_start_date),\n    by = \"person_id\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tally()\n\n# Source:   SQL [?? x 1]\n# Database: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1//tmp/RtmpeMsgL7/file41a06b4682e3.duckdb]\n       n\n   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 410683",

    "text": "8.1 What is a cohort?\nWhen conducting research using the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM), we often aim to identify groups of individuals who share specific characteristics. The inclusion criteria for these groups can range from relatively simple (e.g. people diagnosed with asthma) to highly complex (e.g. adults diagnosed with asthma who had at least one year of prior observation in the database before their diagnosis, no prior history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and no history of using short-acting beta-antagonists).\nThe groups of individuals we identify are called cohorts. In the OMOP CDM, cohorts are represented using a specific structure: a cohort table with four required fields:\nIndividuals must be defined in the person table and must be under observation (i.e. have an ongoing record in the observation period table) to be part of a cohort. Individuals can enter a cohort multiple times, but the time periods in which they are in the cohort cannot overlap.\nIt is beyond the scope of this book to describe all the different ways cohorts could be created, however in this chapter we provide a summary of some of the key building blocks for cohort creation. Cohort-building pipelines can be created following these principles to create a wide range of study cohorts.",

Also, the cdm and vocabulary versions are recorded in the settings by the CohortConstructor package.\nSecond, we can get counts of each cohort.\n\ncohortCount(cdm$covid) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 3\n$ cohort_definition_id &lt;int&gt; 1\n$ number_records       &lt;int&gt; 964\n$ number_subjects      &lt;int&gt; 964\n\n\nWhere you can see the number of records and number of subjects for each cohort.

For database backends, these attributes are stored directly in the database so that they persist for when we read them again. Note that although it may appear that there is only one table—cdm$covid—in fact, four tables are written to the database:\n\nlistSourceTables(cdm = cdm)\n\n[1] \"covid\"           \"covid_attrition\" \"covid_codelist\"  \"covid_set\"      \n\n\nWe do not have to worry about the attributes and the naming of the tables as CohortConstructor, CDMConnector and omopgenerics take care of that and if we create the cohorts with functions such as conceptCohort() then we will be able to read them back with the cohortTables argument of cdmFromCon() or the readSourceTable() function and all the attributes will be in place.",

We can do that with the renameCohort() utility function:\n\ncdm$my_cohort &lt;- cdm$my_cohort |&gt;\n  requirePriorObservation(\n    minPriorObservation = 365,\n    cohortId = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  renameCohort(\n    cohortId = 1,\n    newCohortName = \"concept_1_365_obs\"\n  )\nsettings(cdm$my_cohort)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  cohort_definition_id cohort_name       cdm_version vocabulary_version\n                 &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;             \n1                    1 concept_1_365_obs 5.3         v5.0 22-JUN-22    \n2                    2 concept_2         5.3         v5.0 22-JUN-22    \n# ℹ 1 more variable: min_prior_observation &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nNote that for arguments such as cohortId, targetCohortId, etc., we are able to use the name of the cohort of interest. See for example:\n\ncdm$my_cohort &lt;- cdm$my_cohort |&gt;\n  requireSex(sex = \"Female\", cohortId = \"concept_2\") |&gt;\n  renameCohort(\n    cohortId = \"concept_2\",\n    newCohortName = \"concept_2_female\"\n  )\nsettings(cdm$my_cohort)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 6\n  cohort_definition_id cohort_name       cdm_version vocabulary_version\n                 &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;             \n1                    1 concept_1_365_obs 5.3         v5.0 22-JUN-22    \n2                    2 concept_2_female  5.3         v5.0 22-JUN-22    \n# ℹ 2 more variables: min_prior_observation &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nThis functionality also applies to other packages, such as CohortCharacteristics, PatientProfiles and DrugUtilisation. In some cases, it is useful to add the cohort_name as a column to not have to check manually the equivalence between cohort definition id and cohort name.

    "text": "9.1 Adding intersection variables\nStudies using the OMOP CDM often start with creating patient cohorts. Typically we begin by identifying a target (exposure) cohort. We can then create various other cohorts, for example, to characterise the comorbidities of individuals at time of entry into the target cohort or to summarise the occurrence of a health outcome after entering the target cohort. These intersections between our target cohort and other cohorts (or even other tables in the OMOP CDM) can take many forms and will typically require temporal logic. The PatientProfiles R package addresses these challenges by providing a suite of flexible functions to support the calculation of intersections between our target cohorts and other cohorts, concept sets, or other OMOP CDM tables.",

    "text": "9.1.1 Intersections between cohorts\nSuppose we are interested in studying patients with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and describing their use of different medicines. We will first create one cohort for patients with GI bleeding (our target cohort). Next we can create another cohort for patients with exposure to acetaminophen, celecoxib, and diclofenac. When creating these medication cohorts we will only create them for individuals in our GI bleeding cohort Below we create these cohorts using the GiBleed synthetic database (a characterisation of this dataset can be found here).\nFirst we will load libraries and create a cdm reference for the dataset.\n\nlibrary(omock)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(CodelistGenerator)\nlibrary(PatientProfiles)\nlibrary(CohortCharacteristics)\nlibrary(CohortConstructor)\nlibrary(omopgenerics)\n\ncdm &lt;- mockCdmFromDataset(\n  datasetName = \"GiBleed\",\n  source = \"duckdb\"\n)\n\n\ncdm\n\n\n\n\n── # OMOP CDM reference (duckdb) of GiBleed ────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n• omop tables: care_site, cdm_source, concept, concept_ancestor, concept_class,\nconcept_relationship, concept_synonym, condition_era, condition_occurrence,\ncost, death, device_exposure, domain, dose_era, drug_era, drug_exposure,\ndrug_strength, fact_relationship, location, measurement, metadata, note,\nnote_nlp, observation, observation_period, payer_plan_period, person,\nprocedure_occurrence, provider, relationship, source_to_concept_map, specimen,\nvisit_detail, visit_occurrence, vocabulary\n\n\n• cohort tables: -\n\n\n• achilles tables: -\n\n\n• other tables: -\n\n\nNext we will define the codes used to identify our cohorts.

Here for example we add flag variables using the concepts for each medications. In this example we allow the intersection to use records out of observation which would not have been possible when using cohorts (as cohort entries must be, by definition, within observation). One thing to note though is that now we do not have any logic around collapsing medication records within a week of each other (which was done above when creating medication cohorts).\n\ncdm$gi_bleed &lt;- cdm$gi_bleed |&gt;\n  addConceptIntersectFlag(\n    conceptSet = medication_codes,\n    window = list(\n      \"cs_flag_prior\" = c(-Inf, -1),\n      \"cs_flag_on_index\" = c(0, 0),\n      \"cs_flag_post\" = c(1, Inf)\n    ),\n    inObservation = FALSE\n  )\n\ncdm$gi_bleed |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nRows: ??\nColumns: 37\nDatabase: DuckDB 1.4.1 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.4.1//tmp/Rtmp8gLiPT/file423246d8c89d.duckdb]\n$ cohort_definition_id           &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ subject_id                     &lt;int&gt; 304, 2542, 3513, 616, 4923, 4578, 1070,…\n$ cohort_start_date              &lt;date&gt; 1998-05-03, 2003-04-24, 2008-01-02, 20…\n$ cohort_end_date                &lt;date&gt; 1998-05-03, 2003-04-24, 2008-01-02, 20…\n$ acetaminophen_flag_on_index    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ diclofenac_flag_prior          &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ acetaminophen_flag_post        &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ acetaminophen_flag_prior       &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ celecoxib_flag_prior           &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ celecoxib_flag_on_index        &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ diclofenac_flag_on_index       &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ celecoxib_flag_post            &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ diclofenac_flag_post           &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ diclofenac_count_prior         &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ acetaminophen_count_index      &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ acetaminophen_count_prior      &lt;dbl&gt; 5, 4, 4, 2, 7, 5, 4, 4, 3, 1, 7, 7, 4, …\n$ celecoxib_count_prior          &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ acetaminophen_count_post       &lt;dbl&gt; 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, …\n$ celecoxib_count_index          &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ diclofenac_count_index         &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ celecoxib_count_post           &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ diclofenac_count_post          &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ acetaminophen_date_post        &lt;date&gt; 2003-09-03, 2005-04-04, 2016-07-08, 20…\n$ celecoxib_date_post            &lt;date&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ diclofenac_date_post           &lt;date&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ acetaminophen_days_prior       &lt;dbl&gt; -7411, -678, -6162, -6577, -5812, -584,…\n$ celecoxib_days_prior           &lt;dbl&gt; -46, NA, -32, -87, -22, -20, -46, NA, -…\n$ diclofenac_days_prior          &lt;dbl&gt; NA, -48, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, -71, NA, N…\n$ acetaminophen_cs_flag_post     &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ acetaminophen_cs_flag_prior    &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ celecoxib_cs_flag_prior        &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ acetaminophen_cs_flag_on_index &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ diclofenac_cs_flag_prior       &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ celecoxib_cs_flag_on_index     &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ diclofenac_cs_flag_on_index    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ celecoxib_cs_flag_post         &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ diclofenac_cs_flag_post        &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n\n\nWe can also get counts based on concept sets.

    "text": "Learning more\nTidy R programming with the OMOP Common Data Model aims to (1) explain the main principles for working with databases from R and (2) how to apply these principles and use them with the OMOP CDM. Hopefully, after reading this book, you can understand how the dplyr and dbplyr packages interact with the databases, in particular with data formatted to the OMOP CDM; how the cdm_reference object can be used to extract and identify your population of interest; and add the desired features to your dataset. Note that in this book we always worked with relatively small synthetic data with unrealistic performance. Any analysis conducted with real-world data and big databases will take more time, that’s why we would always recommend you test your code against synthetic data or subsets of your data to ensure good performance. Be careful, especially while writing custom code using join functions that can create some ugly SQL.\nIf you find this book useful then joining the Tidy R in OMOP OHDSI working group will likely be of interest. Building on many of the concepts and tools seen in this book, the Tidy R in OMOP OHDSI working group aims to (1) create and promote a unified set of resources to guide Tidy R development in OMOP and support the OHDSI community, and (2) establish an overview of available packages relevant to Tidy R programming in OMOP (tidyverse style packages). If you are interested in joining the working group then please email Martí Català or Raivo Kolde.",
