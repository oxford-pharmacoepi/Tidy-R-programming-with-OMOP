# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Is this book for me?

We've written this book for anyone interested in a working with databases mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) in a tidyverse inspired approach. That is, human centered, consistent, composable, and inclusive (see <https://design.tidyverse.org/unifying.html> for more details on these principles).

New to the OMOP CDM? We'd recommend you pare this book with [The Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/)

New to R? We recommend you compliment the book with [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
